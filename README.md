<h1>A Web App: 2018 Central Park Squirrel Sightings</h1>
<p>
    We kept track of all the known squirrels at central park and built a web app which would allow others to add, update, and view squirrel data. We created a map that displayed the locations of 100 squirrel sightings. Also, we listed all squirrels with detailed information about their latitude, longitude, unique squirrel ID, shift,age, fur color and habits.
